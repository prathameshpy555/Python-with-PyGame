002 Intro PyGame Code :

Key takeaways from this chapter
The Pygame import statement is always placed at the beginning of the program. It imports the pygame classes,methods and attributes into the current name space. Now this new methods can be called via pygame.method().



For exemple we can now initialize or quit pygame with the following command:



pygame.init()

pygame.quit()



The function display.set_mode() sets the screen size. It returns a

Surface object wich we assign to the variable screen. This variable will be one of the most used variables. It represents the window we see:



screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 240))

You can now run this program and test it. At this moment it does very little. It opens a window and closes it immediately
